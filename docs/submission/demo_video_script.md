# TherapiBot: Demo Video Script

**Total Length:** ~2 minutes

**Style:** Fast-paced, engaging, and inspiring.

---

### Scene 1: The Problem (0-15 seconds)

**Visual:**
*   Opens with a close-up shot of a person looking stressed or discouraged, staring into a mirror.
*   Text overlays appear on the screen, representing negative thoughts: "I'm not smart enough," "I always mess things up," "I'll never be successful."
*   The screen has a cool, slightly desaturated color grade.

**Audio (Narrator - warm, friendly voice):**
"We all have that voice in our head. The one that tells us we're not good enough. But what if you could talk back? What if you had a cognitive counter-speaker in your corner, 24/7?"

### Scene 2: Introducing TherapiBot (15-30 seconds)

**Visual:**
*   The person from Scene 1 pulls out their phone.
*   The TherapiBot app interface is shown on the screen.
*   The color grade of the video shifts to be warmer and more vibrant.

**Audio (Narrator):**
"Introducing TherapiBot. A voice-driven AI companion that helps you challenge and reframe negative thoughts in real-time."

### Scene 3: TherapiBot in Action (30-90 seconds)

**Visual:**
*   The user speaks into their phone.
*   **User:** "I'm just not good enough to apply for that job."
*   An animation shows the audio waveform being processed. The screen splits to show three "agents" working in parallel (labeled "Analyst," "Empath," and "Pacer").
    *   **Analyst:** Text bubble shows "Cognitive Distortion: Emotional Reasoning."
    *   **Empath:** A heart icon pulses, and a text bubble shows "Tone: Discouraged, needs support."
    *   **Pacer:** A metronome animation is shown, and a text bubble shows "Pace: Calm, reassuring."
*   The three agent outputs merge into a single response.
*   The ElevenLabs logo appears briefly.
*   The user listens to the response, and their expression changes from discouraged to thoughtful, and then to a small, confident smile.

**Audio (TherapiBot - calm, empathetic, slightly cheeky voice from ElevenLabs):**
"Feeling 'not good enough' is a powerful emotion, but it's a feeling, not a fact. The job description lists skills you already have. What if you focused on your strengths instead of your doubts? Let's reframe that: 'I have the skills for this role, and I am capable of learning the rest.' Sounds a bit more accurate, doesn't it?"

### Scene 4: How It Works (90-105 seconds)

**Visual:**
*   Simple, clean animated diagram showing the technology stack.
*   Raindrop logo appears with the text "Multi-Agent Orchestration."
*   ElevenLabs logo appears with the text "Human-like Voice Generation."

**Audio (Narrator):**
"TherapiBot is powered by a sophisticated multi-agent system orchestrated by Raindrop, allowing for nuanced, context-aware responses. And with ElevenLabs, the voice is not just realistic; it's emotionally intelligent."

### Scene 5: The Vision & Call to Action (105-120 seconds)

**Visual:**
*   Quick cuts showing different use cases: a person using TherapiBot before a presentation, another using it while looking at a smart mirror, and a third using it on the go with headphones.
*   The final shot shows the TherapiBot logo and the project name.
*   Text on screen: "Find us on Devpost" and the GitHub repository URL.

**Audio (Narrator):**
"This is more than an app; it's a step towards democratizing mental wellness. TherapiBot: Your cognitive counter-speaker. Check out our project on Devpost to learn more."
